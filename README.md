# Data Science Internship: Task Implementations

## Project Overview

This project contains implementations of two key tasks as part of a Data Science internship. The tasks are organized into separate folders, each addressing a specific problem.

### Task Descriptions

1. **Task 1: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Mountain Names**  
   The goal is to train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify mountain names from text data.  
   - Folder: `Task_1`
   
2. **Task 2: Sentinel-2 Image Matching**  
   This task involves matching satellite images from the Sentinel-2 dataset using both classical and deep learning approaches for detecting environmental changes over time.  
   - Folder: `Task_2`

### Resources

All relevant files, datasets, and pre-trained model weights for both tasks can be found in this shared Google Drive folder:

### Potential Improvements

The `Potential_Improvements.pdf` document provides a list of ideas and potential improvements for enhancing the implementations of both tasks. This document includes suggestions for better model architectures, dataset handling, and additional features.
